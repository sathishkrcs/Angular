Angular Boot Process
--------------------

- Load Html into browser.
- If you have any css, scripts are downloaded and initialized by browser.
- Your Script has to be loaded once DOM is ready.
- Js has event callback called #window.onload so you have to initialize your application code into the callback.

``` javascript
function init() {
}
var init = function() {
}

window.onload =init;
```
